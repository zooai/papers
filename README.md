## Papers

Zoo Labs Foundation is dedicated to open AI research and development. Our research focuses on:

- Decentralized semantic learning protocols
- Byzantine-robust prior aggregation
- Active inference at network scale
- Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus mechanisms

### Zen AI Model Family (Base Frontier Models)

**Repository**: https://github.com/zenlm/papers  
**Co-developed by**: Hanzo AI Inc & Zoo Labs Foundation

Zen AI is a comprehensive family of ultra-efficient language models serving as the **base underlying frontier models** co-developed by Hanzo AI and Zoo Labs Foundation. All models are based on Qwen3 architectures with innovative optimizations.

- **Main Whitepaper**: [ZEN_WHITEPAPER_2025.md](https://github.com/zenlm/papers/blob/main/ZEN_WHITEPAPER_2025.md) (v1.0.1)
  - Complete Zen ecosystem: 600M to 480B parameters
  - 95% reduction in energy consumption
  - Recursive AI Self-Improvement System (RAIS) achieving 94% effectiveness
  - Edge deployment enabling privacy-preserving AI

- **Model Documentation**: Visit https://github.com/zenlm/papers for:
  - **Core Models**: Nano (600M edge), Eco (balanced), Coder (code gen), Omni (multimodal), Next (MoE), Guard (safety)
  - **Specialized Models**: Artist, Designer, Scribe, Director, and more
  - **Architecture Overview**: Complete technical specifications and training methodologies
  - **Deployment Guides**: Edge computing, cloud optimization, hybrid strategies

### Partnership Model

Zoo Labs Foundation (501c3) partners with Hanzo AI (Techstars '17) to:
- Advance open AI research
- Ensure model accessibility
- Promote privacy-preserving AI
- Enable edge deployment for everyone

This unique partnership ensures that cutting-edge AI remains accessible while advancing the state of the art.
